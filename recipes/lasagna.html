    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Making lasagna can be time-consuming, but the results are well worth the wait. You'll find a detailed ingredient list and step-by-step instructions in the recipe below, but let's go over the basics:</p>

    <h2>Ingredients: </h2>
    <ul>
        <li><Strong>Meat:</Strong> This super meaty lasagna has sweet Italian sausage and lean ground beef.</li>
        <li><strong>Onion and garlic:</strong> An onion and two cloves of garlic are cooked with the meat to add tons of flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Tomato products:</strong> You'll need a can of crushed tomatoes, two cans of tomato sauce, and two cans of tomato paste.</li>
        <li><strong>Sugar:</strong> Two tablespoons of white sugar add subtle sweetness and enhance the flavor of the sauce.</li>
        <li><strong>Spices and seasonings:</strong> This lasagna recipe is flavored with fresh parsley, dried basil leaves, salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and black pepper.</li>
        <li><strong>Lasagna noodles:</strong> Use store-bought or homemade lasagna noodles.</li>
        <li><strong>Cheeses: </strong>Parmesan, mozzarella, and ricotta cheese make this lasagna extra decadent.</li>
        <li><strong>Egg:</strong> An egg helps bind the ricotta so it doesn't ooze out of the lasagna when you cut into it.

    <h2>Step-By-Step instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Gather all your ingredients.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium heat until well browned.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for about 1 ½ hours, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 5:</strong> In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 6:</strong> Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li><strong>Step 7:</strong> To assemble, spread 1 ½ cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce, overlapping slightly. Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 ½ cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 8:</strong> Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 9:</strong> Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 10:</strong> Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>

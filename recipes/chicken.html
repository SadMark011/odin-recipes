    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>It's easier than you think to make a crowd-pleasing homemade chicken pot pie. You'll find the step-by step recipe below, but here's a brief overview of what you can expect:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h4>Make The Filling</h4>
            <p>Boil the cubed chicken with the carrots, peas, and celery for about 15 minutes. Drain and set aside. Cook the onions in butter until they're translucent, then stir in the flour and seasonings. Add the chicken broth and milk and simmer until the filling is thick.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Fill and Bake the Pie</h4>
            <p>Place the chicken-vegetable mixture in an unbaked pie crust. Pour the chicken broth mixture over it. Cover with the top crust, seal the edges, and cut slits in the top to allow the steam to escape. Bake until the pastry is golden brown and the filling is bubbly.</p>
        </li>
